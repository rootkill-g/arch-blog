If you stay on stable repository, you will never break your system, that may happen if you switch to unstable repository, but downgrading is just as easy as installing packages.\n2. Fedora : If you're quite comfortable with some unstable packages and you know how to downgrade packages, then you'll almost every time get out of a broken update. And the best part is - The packages are the most up to date if you're using the rawhide, but if you want to stay on the stable versions, those will also be very new updates.\n3. Debian : Stable maybe holding way too old packages that you don't like using debian, but if you switch to the testing or the unstable repositories then you will enjoy a system almost like the fedora.",
